# Analysis of Refugee Migration Patterns

This is a project for the course [DATA16001 Network Analysis](https://courses.helsinki.fi/en/data16001/124845659) at the University of Helsinki in the spring of 2019.

Our aim is to create new insights that help understand migration patterns. These insights could be useful for aid organizations and policy makers alike.
